# Design Journal 01
## Intro
As my first project in this class and my submission for ‘Make a Thing’ I decided to do
a very small-scale and simple project, consisting of a simple ‘reach the goal’ platformer with
hand-drawn sprites and an animated character. The game consists of three levels and an
‘ending screen’, and allows the player to jump on platforms while avoiding the spikes and
falling, both of which cause the game to restart. I used Game Maker to make the simple
game, and Procreate to create the images.
## Why GameMaker?
So then, why did I go about making something so simple in an engine that is unfamiliar to
me? Well, originally I was planning on coding something in JavaScript using the P5 library, a
method that was introduced to me during my first year in Computation Arts, and that I have
since grown very familiar with. However, after some debating, I finally decided I wanted to
use this opportunity to try using a software I was unfamiliar with. I knew the final outcome
would be less elaborate, but being able to experiment in a software I had been meaning to try
felt more compelling.
## Looking Back...
However, saying I had no experience in game Maker would be a lie. In fact, Game
Maker was the first software I ever used to
try to code something many years ago,
following a YouTube tutorial series by Sara
Spaulding in order to familiarize myself.
However, I never finished the game due to
my inexperience. So, returning to Game Maker after three semesters in Computation Arts
was really a test to see what I learnt. I was happy to see that the engine’s language is
incredibly simple and easy to use, and I was able to do most of the coding on my own, while
following the official Game Maker’s tutorial on ‘how to build a simple platformer in 15
minutes’ on YouTube to remind myself how to operate within the engine’s interface.

# Journal 02 January 29th 2025
## Getting Started... sort of.
After the first class, I was excited to get to exploring in Unity. Although I have not tried Unity before, it seemed quite similar in some ways to softwares like Maya and Unreal Engine, which I am relatively familiar with. I was looking forward to experimenting. However, I also decided to finally commit to getting myself a laptop, something that I haven't owned during my studies until now (shocking!). I then made the decision that I woud begin working on the Unity explorations once I got the new device, which unfortunately didn't end up being until monday. 
Then came trying to get Unity onto my laptop. for some reason, I had quite a few difficulties. Luckily, I did get it to download, and everything works well, but I sadly didn't get the chance to do the explorations.
Needless to say, this week was definetly more dedicated to getting myself set up for the new semester. It also didn't help that last class was cut short due to unexpected changes in Unity 6, which resulted in complications in the lesson.Well! Better luck next week.
## But... brainstorming for future projects!
Although this week was mostly dedicated to trying to set myself up for the coming semester, I did find myself thinking about where to go in terms of project direction moving forward in the class. My main interest being the possibility of continuing a story-based game that I, working with Olivia Axiuk, created a very short demo for in another class.
The game we imagined, called "Think" is a story-based visual-novel type of game that incorporates puzzle elements, item collection, and environment exploration to advance a branching storyline that the player can explore. The player plays through the eyes of a young woman in her early College years, and delves into the concequences that mental health disorders, isolation and trauma can have on both the individual suffering and those around them.
Of course, the demo is an extremel bare-bones version of the original idea, but I am still very much inspired by it and wish to continue developing on it in hopes of seeing it completed with all the previously imagined functionalities. Although the project was originally done in JavaScript, I think using a game engine will really help with it's development.

That's all for now!
