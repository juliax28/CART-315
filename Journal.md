# Design Journal 01
## Intro
As my first project in this class and my submission for ‘Make a Thing’ I decided to do
a very small-scale and simple project, consisting of a simple ‘reach the goal’ platformer with
hand-drawn sprites and an animated character. The game consists of three levels and an
‘ending screen’, and allows the player to jump on platforms while avoiding the spikes and
falling, both of which cause the game to restart. I used Game Maker to make the simple
game, and Procreate to create the images.
## Why GameMaker?
So then, why did I go about making something so simple in an engine that is unfamiliar to
me? Well, originally I was planning on coding something in JavaScript using the P5 library, a
method that was introduced to me during my first year in Computation Arts, and that I have
since grown very familiar with. However, after some debating, I finally decided I wanted to
use this opportunity to try using a software I was unfamiliar with. I knew the final outcome
would be less elaborate, but being able to experiment in a software I had been meaning to try
felt more compelling.
## Looking Back...
However, saying I had no experience in game Maker would be a lie. In fact, Game
Maker was the first software I ever used to
try to code something many years ago,
following a YouTube tutorial series by Sara
Spaulding in order to familiarize myself.
However, I never finished the game due to
my inexperience. So, returning to Game Maker after three semesters in Computation Arts
was really a test to see what I learnt. I was happy to see that the engine’s language is
incredibly simple and easy to use, and I was able to do most of the coding on my own, while
following the official Game Maker’s tutorial on ‘how to build a simple platformer in 15
minutes’ on YouTube to remind myself how to operate within the engine’s interface.
